I'm getting a hello world for a new blog built using blogdown.  Big thanks to Alison Presmanes Hill for her [great blog post](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) of how to get started.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)


ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle('this should be fun!')
```
